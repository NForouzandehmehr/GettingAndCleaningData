Introduction

This repository contains my course project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course on Coursera , as part of the Data Science specialization. 
The purpose of the project was to obtain, clean and summarise a real-life dataset. The input data set used was from the accelerometers and gyroscopes of a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. This data was produced as part of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones project.
The data used can be downloaded from here:
